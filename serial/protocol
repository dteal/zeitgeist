packet from button board
========================

aa (header)

01 (mode; 01 off, 02 on)

00 (becomes 03 when single pressed)

00 (power output; 2's complement) (normally 00, max 08, min, can signal both)?

00 (unknown, zero?)

xx (current angle of board as measured by encoder)

00 (unknown, zero?)

xx xx (current speed of wheel as measured by encoder; 2's complement)

00 00 00 00 00 00 (unknown, zero?)

xx (checksum8 modulo 256 of previous 15 bytes (see https://www.scadacore.com/tools/programming-calculators/online-checksum-calculator/))

packet from other board
=======================

aa (header)

01 (mode; 01 off, 02 on; can be initialized by either board?)

00 (unknown, zero?)

00 (becomes 03 when single pressed)

00 (unknown, zero?)

xx (current angle of board as measured by encoder)

xx xx (current speed of wheel as measured by encoder; 2's complement)

e4 04 dc 04 (unknown, first and third byte fluctuate by a bit)

00 00 00  (unknown, zero?)

xx (checksum, same)
